# YonaLink Automation Test Architecture - Question Answers

## Question 1: How would you design an automation test architecture to cover these components?

### System Components Coverage

**API Layer Testing Strategy:**
Our automation architecture covers the API layer through a comprehensive three-tier approach. The unit testing layer focuses on individual API endpoints, testing data ingestion capabilities for both JSON and CSV formats. This ensures that the system can properly receive and process different data types as specified in the requirements. The integration testing layer validates the data mapping functionality, ensuring that incoming data is correctly transformed to existing standard options. The contract testing layer provides schema validation to guarantee that API responses meet the expected data structure and format requirements.

**Forms Management System Testing Strategy:**
For the forms management system, our architecture implements UI testing to cover form creation, editing, and deletion workflows. This ensures that users can effectively manage digital forms according to their specific needs. Data population testing verifies that forms are automatically populated with data received from the API layer, creating a seamless connection between the two system components. Cross-browser testing ensures that the forms management functionality works consistently across different browsers and environments.

**End-to-End Testing Integration:**
The architecture includes complete user journey testing that validates the entire workflow from API data ingestion through to form population. This ensures that the system components work together harmoniously and that data flows correctly from the API layer to the forms management system without loss or corruption.
